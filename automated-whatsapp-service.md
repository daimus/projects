# Automated WhatsApp Service

## Background

Every company strives to build an employee information system that covers attendance and more. Employees can work from anywhere, whether at a clientâ€™s site or in the office. However, they often forget to mark their attendance, making a reminder system necessary.

Most company attendance systems are web-based, which means push notifications are not an option. After exploring various solutions, the most effective method was determined to be WhatsApp, as 100% of employees use it.

## **The Process I Worked On**

Sending WhatsApp messages is easy, but what if the sender is a computer? WhatsApp provides an official API, but itâ€™s too expensive, so I had to find an alternative. Thanks to Baileys, a library that allows interaction with WhatsApp, I found a way. It works like a web scraper, fetching and setting data while simulating WhatsApp Web.

However, there was a challengeâ€”I couldnâ€™t send messages directly through Baileys. To solve this, I had to create a wrapper to interact with it. Fortunately, I had already built one before ðŸ˜„, so I can say this project was 90% done before it even started. I published the API on GitHub: [github.com/daimus/whatsapp-api](https://github.com/daimus/whatsapp-api). This project allows interaction with WhatsApp via REST API or a scheduler.

So, what was the remaining 10%? Implementing the reminder was straightforwardâ€”I just needed a template and a list of employee phone numbers. However, there was an additional requirement: if an employee hadnâ€™t marked attendance by 3 PM or 4 PM, they should receive another reminder. To handle this, I had to create a job that gathers a list of employees with incomplete attendance and sends them a reminder.

At first, everything seemed fine, but then I realized reminders shouldnâ€™t be sent on holidays. To fix this, I created a list of public holidays in Indonesia and excluded those dates from the job execution.

So far, the reminder system works wellâ€”the scheduler, reminders, and job exclusions all function as expected. Since it proved useful, I decided to improve it by adding a web UI for Human Capital (HC). This was well received, as HC could also use it to send birthday greetings and broadcast important company announcements. Even after I left the company, this reminder system continued to be used for attendance reminders and message broadcasting.
